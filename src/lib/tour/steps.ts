// page is a dynamic /jobs/[id] route — no fixed string can describe every
// match), resolveNext (the specific job to click into has to be discovered
// at click time, since it depends on which jobs are currently send-able),
// and resolveElement (same idea for the target element itself — the "which
// job card" step can't point at a static data-tour id since it must be the
// SAME card resolveNext is about to navigate into, not just any card).

// into it. Kept as one function so they can never disagree on which card.
